"You get what you pay for" seems to have no merit when it comes to these props. I fell in love with them. Where the HQ carbon mix props have great flight characteristics and good balance, these newcomers have indestructability of the DAL props. Right now they only make 6040 and 5040s. They don't give insane thrust like the bullnose *45 or triblades, but you get some efficiency benefits from a general purpose prop.

They come packaged in boxes of 10 pairs and only [cost about $6](http://www.banggood.com/KINGKONG-6040-Propellers-CW-CCW-10-Pairs-For-QAV250-RC-Multirotors-p-988179.html). You heard that right. You would never expect such great balance and finish from something this cheap. I hope they can keep the quality and price as they become more popular. Because they will. They are so much better than the gemfans that break when you look at them badly.
