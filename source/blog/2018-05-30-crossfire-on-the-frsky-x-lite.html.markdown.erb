The short version: It is perfectly possible to run both the "fullsize" and the "micro" versions of the Crossfire TX on the nex small Frsky X-Lite radio. Or I should say controller. Love the thing.

You simply disable the internal module and enable CRSF for the external one. Just like any other Frsky radio/opentx. The pins map perfectly sequentially (see schematic below). There are three extra pis on the X-lite you won't need.

Be very careful when opening the radio, and <eM>remove the SD card</em> prior to opening. I've broken my SD and shorted it so that smoke came out during the live stream and I burnt myself :) Surprisingly the card reader survived.

Here's the whole live stream I got the CRSF working. Most of it is in Czech, but there is an english summary at the end.
