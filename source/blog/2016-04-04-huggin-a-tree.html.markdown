Has a great little session on the Sunday Morning in Osečná nearby. I've flown around that area 
last year and I'm happy to say I can now fly *through* the tree, not just around it :)

The best part of this session was that my son started flying acro, so it's not far off where
we can tandem fly places. Cannot wait.
