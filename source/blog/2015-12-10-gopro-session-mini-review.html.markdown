Gopro has recently cut the price of the GoPro Session in half, so I couldn't resist getting one (Don't ask how many action cams I got already). It is not as cheap as a Foxeer Legend1 or Xiaomi Yi, not as sharp as a hero4 silver or hero3+ black, but with a great superview aesthetic and a $199 pricetag it's a great option.
