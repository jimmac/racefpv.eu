As my hobby has slowly overshadowed everything else I do in my spare time, I decided to set up a dedicated site for all things FPV. The intent is to share as much as I've learned over the year or so and help others with my experiences. 

FPV space is pretty neat in terms of transparency. Most flight controllers have open source code, and even the ESCs run open code (simonk or blheli). Sadly information about how to get started is fairly scattered around and is clouded by a solid cloud of elitism. 

Please be patient as I get the site up and running as the time is scarce. Luckily for you, winter is pretty hostile to flying, so I should have some time to sink into this :)
