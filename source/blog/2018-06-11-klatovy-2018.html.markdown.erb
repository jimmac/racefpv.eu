Racing in Klatovy is always a pinnacle of the season. Not because it's some prestigious event that will get you a lot of exposure, but because it's super laid back. It's where you meet with the whole Czech racing community during wonderful summer days, enjoy some night races and drinks. Always a pleasure to be part of it.

This year both me and my 9Y old son flew some decent qualifying times, but then got eliminated in the races. Nevertheless enjoyed it 100%.

Huge shout out to Kuba Toman & Team for organizing yet another one of these amazing events. Thank you.
