  I'm going to list all my quads setups here, along with all the NAZE32 Cleanflight/baseflight settings. This might help you get an idea what works for me and perhaps help with your own purchases/builds.

  
  ### DALRC XR220  ###

  </p>
  
  Off the shelf frame with a unibody base. Supposedly doesn't take much beating and the PDB tends to burst into flames. I have so far been very lucky. It's a light setup and I'm sporting the supe fast racekraft 5051s making this my fastest racing frame, capable of carrying a gopro session.

  ### PLAto ###

  <p class="image full">
    <img src="/images/hangar/PLAto.jpg"/>
  </p>
    
  For indoor racing with a 250g limit, this guy comes at around 210g with an 800mAh graphene 3S. The frame is  great [design by t4b](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1783281), printed with PLA. The frame should probably be cut from CF, but so far it has survived my "soft landings".
  
  I've designed a custom [camera canopy](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2033337) that holds the Aomway 600tvl camera that gives a better picture than the 170 degree micro cameras usually used in such small builds.
  
  I started with emax 1306 motors, but the DYS 1407/3600kv are way more powerful with only a slight increase of weight. Definitely recommend going 1407.

  ### Red20RC BDX Racer ###

  <p class="image full">
    <img src="/images/hangar/bdxr.jpg"/>
  </p>
    
  I've got 4 BDX Racer quads suitable for both racing and freestyle. As the weight is becoming an issue with non-unibody frames, I'm slowly phasing out the BDXR from racing and keeping them as my day to day bashers/freestyle quads.
  
  I've finally bought the Connex Prosight HD system and one of the BDXRs is equipped with that. Overall the BDXR is still light enough to be competititve and is extremely durable. Been through some very rough crashes. The early designs had a weakness in the camera housing, but that has since been resolved.
