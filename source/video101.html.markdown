## Shooting Beautiful Video ##

Don't get me wrong. Experiencing the flight from the first person perspective is an amazing feeling in itself. But sharing that experience, perhaps multiplied by some great music, is a great feeling too. So what kind of gear will you need? What sort of software is necessy and what kind of workflow do I use?

Depending on how much money you're willing to spend, here's a list of cameras you may get. I don't necessarily mean the amount needed to start recording, but the amount of money you are willing to lose in a crash. As I've mentioned miniquads are about crashing as much they are about flying.

There is quite a plethora of cameras you can choose on a wide price spectrum. But generally all the cheap chinese gopro clones are garbage. That doesn't mean you won't be able to find a gem I missed, but here's a list of proven cameras with all their advantages and diadvantages:

### Gopro Hero 4 Black ###

It makes no sense to get the silver edition as the LCD is just added weight. Gopro is the king of the action cameras and deservingly so. The cameras provide the best sharpness, automatic exposure and quality. The wide angle lens has lovely anti glare coating, giving a unique tint to the footage I actually like. You can also shoot in something they call prores, a very flat profile capturing the most difficult dynamic range situatons and giving you the ability to fix or color grade/tint the footage in post. Hero4 now shoots in 4K resolution at 30 frames per second.

# Cons #

  - Heavy
